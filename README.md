# HomeRemedyUi

This project, HomeRemedyFrontEnd, is an integral part of the Home Remedy Application suite, which includes the backend component [HomeRemedyApp](https://github.com/apastukhanov/HomeRemedyApp). 
It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.3 and serves as the user interface for managing and accessing the home-based pharmacy and disease directory.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

For more help on the Angular CLI, use `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Integration with Home First Aid Kit

HomeRemedyUi works in tandem with the Home First Aid Kit backend. Ensure the backend server is running to enable full functionality of the UI, including access to the medication database and disease directory.

### Connecting to the Backend

1. **Ensure Backend is Running**: Start the 'Home First Aid Kit' backend application.
2. **Set up Environment Variables**: Configure the necessary environment variables to connect to the backend (e.g., API endpoints).
